### Garlic Focaccia
	1 whole head garlic
	5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
	Kosher salt, for seasoning
	500g all-purpose or bread flour (17 1/2 ounces; about 3 1/4 cups)
	15g kosher salt (1/2 ounce; about 1 tablespoon)
	4g instant yeast (0.15 ounce; about 1 teaspoon)
	325g water (11 1/2 ounces; about 1 1/2 cups minus 1 tablespoon)
	For the Garlic Butter:
	2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter
	2 teaspoons dried oregano
	1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
	
	This recipe must be started the day before
	
	Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Remove 4 cloves garlic from head and set aside. Place remaining head in the center of a sheet of aluminum foil. 
	Drizzle with 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil and season with salt. Wrap tightly with foil and place in an oven-safe cast iron, carbon steel, or stainless steel skillet, then transfer to oven. 
	Roast until garlic is completely tender, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and refrigerate until ready to use the next day.

	Combine flour, salt, yeast, and water in a large bowl. (To account for rising, the bowl should be at least 4 to 6 times the volume of the dough.) Mix with hands or a wooden spoon until no dry flour remains.

	Cover bowl tightly, making sure that edges are well sealed, then let rest on the countertop for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Dough should rise dramatically and fill bowl.

	Add 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil to a 12-inch cast iron skillet or large cake pan. Transfer dough to pan by tipping it out of the bowl in one large blob. Turn dough to coat in oil. 
	Using a flat palm, press dough around skillet, flattening it slightly and spreading oil around the entire bottom and sides of pan. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough stand at room temperature for 2 hours. 
	After the first hour, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 550°F (290°C).

	At the end of the 2 hours, dough should mostly fill skillet, up to its edge. Use your fingertips to press it around until it fills every corner, popping any large bubbles that appear. 
	Lift up one edge of dough to let any air bubbles underneath escape. Repeat, moving around dough, until no air bubbles are left underneath and dough is evenly spread around skillet. 
	Peel roasted garlic cloves and break up large cloves into 2 or 3 pieces each. Scatter roasted garlic evenly over surface of dough, then push down on each clove until it is embedded in a deep well of dough.

	Transfer skillet to oven and bake until top is golden brown and bubbly and bottom appears golden brown and crisp when you lift it with a thin spatula, 16 to 24 minutes. 
	If bottom is not as crisp as desired, place pan on a burner and cook over medium heat, moving pan around to cook evenly, until bottom of focaccia is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes.

	Meanwhile, Make the Garlic Butter: Mince 4 reserved raw cloves of garlic. Combine remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil with butter in a small skillet and melt over medium-low heat. 
	Add garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant and garlic is just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl and season with salt.

	When focaccia has finished baking, spread garlic butter over top with a spoon. Transfer to a cutting board, allow to cool slightly, slice, and serve. 
	Extra bread should be stored in a brown paper bag at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat in a 300°F (150°C) oven for about 10 minutes before serving.
	
### Honey Buttermilk Oatbread
	3 1/3 cups bread flour
	1/2 cup rolled oats
	1/3 cup oat bran
	2 tablespoons dry milk powder
	1/2 teaspoon baking soda
	2 teaspoons salt
	2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
	1/4 cup honey
	1 egg
	1 1/8 cups buttermilk
	1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast or bread machine yeast

### Pita
	1 cup water (8 ounces; 240ml), 105–110°F (41–43°C)
	1 tablespoon (15ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the bowl
	1 tablespoon granulated sugar
	2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast
	1 teaspoon kosher salt
	1/2 cup whole wheat flour (2 1/2 ounces; 70g)
	2 cups all-purpose flour (10 ounces; 280g), plus more for dusting

	In a medium mixing bowl, combine water, oil, sugar, yeast, salt, and whole wheat flour with a wooden spoon until combined and smooth. Stir in all-purpose flour until the mixture comes together into a shaggy mass.

	Using clean hands, knead the dough in the bowl for 10 minutes or until it becomes smooth and very elastic, adding only very small amounts of extra flour if dough is extremely sticky (see note). 
	Alternatively, knead dough at low speed in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment until dough is very elastic and smooth, about 8 minutes.

	Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and form into a smooth ball. Lightly oil a clean mixing bowl and place dough inside, then rub oiled hands over the top of the dough. 
	Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.

	Meanwhile, place a baking steel or an at least 12-inch cast iron skillet on the top oven rack and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Line a plate with a large, clean kitchen towel and set aside.

	Punch down the dough, transfer to a lightly floured work surface, and cut into 6 even pieces. Form each dough piece into an even ball. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.

	Roll each piece of dough into about a 7-inch circle, no more than 1/4 inch thick, taking care not to tear dough and keeping the thickness even all around. 
	Place dough disks on a lightly floured surface, cover with a damp towel, and let proof until slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.

	Working with as many pitas as will fit on the steel at once, pick up each pita and place on the steel top side down. (If using a cast iron skillet, bake one pita at a time.) 
	Immediately close the oven door and bake until pitas have puffed and are slightly golden around the edges, about 3 minutes. Be careful not to over-bake.

	Place baked pitas onto towel-lined plate and wrap with the overhanging towel. Repeat with any remaining pitas.

	For an extra-charred finish, heat a cast iron skillet on the stove top over high heat until smoking. Working with one pita at a time, briefly heat each side until charred in a few spots, about 30 seconds. 
	Return pita to towel and cover. Repeat with remaining pitas and serve immediately.

### Sweet Cream Ice Cream
	9 1/4 lightly toasted sugar (about 1 1/3 cups; 265g)
	1 1/4 ounces cornstarch (1/4 cup; 35g)
	2.5) Kosher salt
	20 ounces whole milk (about 2 1/2 cups; 565g)
	8 ounces heavy cream (about 1 cup; 225g)
	
	To toast sugar you put it in a glass or ceramic dish the oven at 300 Fahrenheit for a couple hours until lightly brown, stiring every hour.
	You want to use good milk and cream for this. Local, full fat, grass fed, however many fancy boxes you can check off. 
	Whisk sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a pot. When no lumps of cornstarch remain, add 14 ounces of the milk (about 1 2/3 cup; 396g) and whisk to combine. 
	Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly but not vigorously, until it begins to simmer. 
	This will take about 6 minutes, if the process seems to be moving slowly, simply turn up the heat. When the mixture comes to a boil, set a timer and continue cooking and whisking for exactly 1 minute. 
	Immediately transfer mixture to a large bowl, then whisk in the remaining milk and cream. Cover and refrigerate the base until cold, thick, and no warmer than 40°F, about 3 hours.
	Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s directions. Meanwhile, place a quart-sized container and flexible spatula in the freezer. 
	When it looks fluffy and thick, shut off the machine and, using the chilled spatula, scrape gelato into the chilled container. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly against the surface, and freeze until thick enough to scoop, about 4 hours.

	Put 2 inches of water in bottom of a pressure cooker and add a small rack (the rack is usually included with every pressure cooker). Put condensed milk on the rack and seal lid. Cook at high pressure for 90 minutes.
	Allow pressure to release naturally. Prepare an ice bath. Once depressurized, open lid and, using tongs, transfer can of caramelized condensed milk to ice bath. Let chill for at least 1 hour, adding more ice as needed, until completely cool: 
	DO NOT OPEN CAN WHILE HOT BECAUSE A HOT CAN OF CARAMELIZED CONDENSED MILK IS STILL UNDER PRESSURE AND CAN ERUPT.
	Put eggs in a blender. Combine heavy cream, cooled caramelized condensed milk, and salt into a medium pot set over medium heat, stirring to dissolve condensed milk into cream. 
	When cream mixture comes to a boil remove pot from the heat.
	Turn blender to low speed and immediately drizzle hot cream mixture into eggs. Increase speed to medium and continue to blend. 
	With the blender still running, add chocolate chips, a few tablespoons at a time, and puree until fully melted; increase blender speed as needed to keep chocolate mousse in motion. 
	Turn blender off and pour chocolate mousse into a large baking dish. Cool chocolate mousse in the refrigerator, uncovered, for at least 4 hours. When cold, cover with plastic wrap

### Potato Gnocchi
	3 pounds (1.4kg) russet potatoes, scrubbed and pierced all over with a fork
	3 egg yolks, lightly beaten
	3/4 cup all-purpose flour (about 3 1/2 ounces; 100g), divided, plus more for dusting and as needed
	Kosher salt
	1 stick unsalted butter (4 ounces; 119g)
	Leaves from 1 large sprig fresh sage (about 15 large and small leaves)
	Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for grating

	Preheat oven to 450°F (232°C). Set potatoes either on a wire rack set over a baking sheet, on a baking sheet lined with a layer of salt, or directly on the oven's racks.
	Bake until completely tender throughout when pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes.
	Transfer potatoes to a work surface. Using tongs to hold hot potatoes, slice each in half lengthwise.
	Using a spoon, scoop potato flesh into a ricer or food mill fitted with the finest disk. Press potato flesh onto a clean work surface, spreading it into an even layer, and allow steam to escape for a few minutes.
	Drizzle egg yolks all over.
	Scoop 1/2 cup flour into a fine-mesh sieve and tap to dust flour all over potatoes.
	Using a pastry blender or bench scraper, chop down repeatedly all over to cut flour and egg into potato.
	Using a bench scraper, gather up shaggy potato mass and pat into a loose ball. Press ball flat with hands, then fold in half using bench scraper and press down again.
	Scoop remaining 1/4 cup flour into sieve and dust all over potato dough. Continue to gently fold and press, just until a uniform dough comes together.
	(Make sure to simply fold and press down; avoid the smearing motion more commonly used when kneading bread.)
	Dust potato dough all over with flour and gently form into a log.
	Clean work area well and dust with fresh flour.
	Using bench scraper, slice off a roughly 2-inch-thick portion of dough and roll into a snake about 1/2 inch thick;
	use a light touch as you roll, trying to use your palms more than your fingers, and dusting as necessary with flour to prevent sticking.
	Using bench scraper, cut snake into 1-inch portions, trimming off uneven ends as necessary. Transfer gnocchi to a well-floured area or baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough.
	Bring a large pot of very well-salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it foams.
	Add sage and fry until very aromatic and butter begins to lightly brown; remove from heat.
	Using a bench scraper or slotted spatula to scoop them up, transfer gnocchi to boiling water. Stir once very gently with a spider or slotted spoon to prevent sticking.
	When gnocchi begin to float to the surface, wait about 20 seconds, then taste one; it should be soft yet cooked through, without any raw-flour flavor.
	Using spider or slotted spoon, scoop gnocchi directly into skillet with sage butter, allowing some of the water clinging to them to come along.
	Cook gnocchi in sage butter over medium-high heat, tossing very gently and adding a splash of cooking water as needed if sauce becomes greasy or breaks, until gnocchi are coated in a rich, creamy sauce, about 1 minute.
	Carefully spoon gnocchi into serving dishes and top with grated Parmesan cheese. Serve right away.

### Deep Dish Pizza
	2 Cup warm water
	1/4 Tablespoon yeast
	1 Tablespoon salt
	2 pounds flour
	1/4 cup melted butter (or olive oil (or corn oil (or avacado oil))) Big debate on what type of oil to use. I can't taste the difference between the oils.
	12 Ounces Cheese (Low moisture works best)
	1 Pound Italian Sausage (Optional but recomended)
	28 Ounces Pizza Sauce
	Cornmeal

	In a mixer combine the water, yeast, and salt. Allow the yeast to dissolve. Add butter/oil, mix. Add flour and begin to mix the dough using a dough hook on low speed. Once a ball is formed mix on medium speed for 
	1 to 2 minutes until the dough becomes elastic and smooth. Remove from the mixer and place in a bowl coated with butter/oil. Allow the dough to rest for approximately 4 hours. Once the dough is rested, place on flat 
	surface and dust with some flour. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a deep baking dish or deep dish pizza pan, spread a bit cornmeal on the bottom of the pan. Spread the dough using your fingers at the bottom of the pan 
	and make sure to have enough dough to come up the sides of the pan approximately 1/2-inch high. It should be a thin layer, no more than 1/2 an inch. Reserve remainder for breadsticks. 
	Place a layer of all the cheese on the bottom of the crust. Use the italian sauage to make a patty that covers the cheese. Add any other desired toppings. Add the tomato sauce. 
	Place in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes until golden and crispy.

### Chicago Thin Crust Pizza
	2 Cups All Purpose Flour
	1/2 Cup Water
	2 1/2 Ounces Corn Oil
	1/2 Teaspoon Active Dry Yeast
	1/2 Teaspoon Salt
	7 Ounces Pizza Sauce
	10 Ounces Cheese (Low Moisture works best)
	Italian Sausage (Optional but recomended)
	
	I haven't found a thin crust recipie I particularly like, but this one is allright.
	Combine Water, Salt, and Yeast. Let yeast rise. Add half of flour and mix. Once it comes together add the oil and 1/4th the flour. Once that comes together need on medium low for 5 minutes. Add remaining flour and mix 
	on medium low for 3 minutes. Dough will be stiff. Feel free to add water a little at a time until it comes together. Place in a bowl and cover then let rise in a warm space for two hours. Punch down and let rise for 
	another two hours. Preheat oven to 475. Portion dough but be gentle with it. Pat out on a dark pan. Pinch up edges to create a rim. Top with sauce, italian sausage, and cheese. Cook on middle rack for 10 minutes.

### Schnitzel
	4 boneless pork steaks or chops,
	1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
	1 teaspoon salt
	2 large eggs, lightly beaten
	3/4 cup plain breadcrumbs
	Oil for frying (use a neutral-tasting oil with a high smoke point)
	Salt and Pepper to taste
	Lemon Slices
	
	Combine 1 teaspoon salt and flour.
	Place the pork chops between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them until just 1/4 inch thick with the flat side of a meat tenderizer. Lightly season both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
	Place the flour mixture, egg, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls. Dip the chops in the flour, the egg, and the breadcrumbs, coating both sides and all edges at each stage. 
	Be careful not to press the breadcrumbs into the meat. Gently shake off the excess crumbs. Don't let the schnitzel sit in the coating or they will not be as crispy once fried - fry immediately.
	Make sure the cooking oil is hot enough at this point (about 330 Fahrenheit) as you don't want the Schnitzel to sit around in the coating before frying. Use enough oil so that the Schnitzels "swim" in it.
	Fry the Schnitzel for about 2-3 minutes on both sides until a deep golden brown. Transfer briefly to a plate lined with paper towels.
	Serve immediately with slices of fresh lemon. Spätzle is good side.

	1/4 teaspoon dried thyme (crumbled)
	6 cups chicken stock
	1 cup heavy cream
	1 ham bone (or ham hock)
	Salt and black pepper to taste
	
	Peel the onion and chop it coarsely.

### Spätzle mit Speck
	1 cup all-purpose flour
	1/2 cup semolina flour
	1 teaspoon Kosher salt, plus more for cooking water and final seasoning
	1 teaspoon each finely minced fresh thyme, fresh sage
	Pinch freshly ground black pepper
	2 eggs
	1/3 – 1/2 cup milk
	3-4 tablespoons unsalted butter
	1/2 cup bread crumbs
	1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
	1-2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
	2 ounces diced bacon
	
	In a mixing bowl, whisk together flours, salt, herbs, and pepper. Beat eggs lightly with 1/3 cup milk and add to dry ingredients. Using a fork, quickly and gently combine wet and dry ingredients. 
	If dough is very thick and difficult to work together, add more milk, up to 1/2 cup in total. Allow dough to rest for about 15 minutes.
	In the meanwhile, prepare a large pot of salted boiling water. Moisten a wooden cutting board with cool water. Spread a portion of the batter in a long strip along the board. 
	Use a large offset spatula to cut off small, thin strips of the batter and drop them into salted, boiling water. Cut the dough at small angles to keep the spätzle from getting too long. As you cut the dough, let the small bits drop into the boiling water. 
	Once the spätzle floats, let them cook at a gentle boil for another 1-2 minutes, until they no longer have a raw flour taste and have a pleasantly firm texture. 
	Remove the cooked spätzle with a strainer and shock briefly in ice water. Drain the cooled spätzle well and spread on a baking sheet to dry further while you continue cutting and cooking remaining dough.
	Heat a skillet over medium heat, melt one tablespoon of butter and add bread crumbs and parsley. Toss to coat evenly and cook until lightly toasted and crisp. Transfer bread crumbs out of pan and set aside.
	Add a small amount of cooking oil (a little more if speck is very lean) to the skillet. Cook speck or bacon until fat is rendered and meat is crispy. Add peas and remaining 2-3 tablespoons of butter. 
	When butter is melted, add spätzle. Cook until spätzle is heated through and slightly browned in some spots. Season with additional salt, to taste.
	Transfer to a serving platter and top with buttered bread crumbs. Serve hot.
